# Travel Site SPA

A responsive, full-stack Single Page Application designed to improve user experience by dynamically serving travel-related content. Built using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular/JavaScript) architecture, this project showcases front-end SPAs, backend integration, and API testing techniques.

##  Project Highlights

- **Migration from MVC to SPA** - Initially built the project using the Model View Controller method and then Migrated to a Single Page Application method 
- **Single Page Interface** – Seamless, client-side routing for fluid navigation and user interaction.
- **Flexible NoSQL Database** – MongoDB stores JSON documents with dynamic structures, allowing schema evolution during development.
- **Refactoring for Performance** – Transitioned from a traditional Express + HTML app to a SPA to enhance responsiveness and UX.
- **API Testing with Postman** – Tested and validated REST endpoints to ensure correct backend responses and reliability.
- **Security Considerations** – Explored implementation of JWT-based authentication; encountered challenges that informed further security refinement.
