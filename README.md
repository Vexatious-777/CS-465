The types of front-end development I used in my full stack project included Express HTML, JavaScript, and a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture...

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database because it allows the ability to store documents with variying structures in the same place enabling flexibility. This in turn enables this project to change what will be stored within the database over time giving this project said flexibility. It also stores data in binary JSON files which is compatible with most modern applications and in this specific case lends itself well to MEAN stacks and works well with this project's requirements.

JSON is different from JavaScript in many ways JSON is a means to store and represent data and the name itself is an acronym that stands for JavaScript Object Notation. While JavaScript is a programming language typically used in web applications, this can either be the front-end user interface or the back-end logic.

There were a few instances during this project where the code was refactored to improve functionality and efficiency such as when it was refactored from an Express HTML-based application to then a Single Page Application that instead of running mostly server-side to one that runs more on the client-side to improve the end-user experience.

The methods for testing various types of API endpoints that I used in this project included the use of API endpoint testing tools, specifically POSTMan in this instance which ensured the code correctly makes the correct calls to particular endpoints and in return received the correct results. The difficulty of adding security measures is larger than one might expect and in this early build of the project, I did not find much success with the suggested security measures and will have to look for other potential ways to include them since my Java Web Tokens (JWT) did not seem to properly be checked against my back end after they are issued to the user client side in my implementation.

This course has helped me reach my professional goals by teaching me about Full-Stack applications in detail and showing me techniques and ideas that facilitate their creation.
Not only that but by made me more familiar with version control systems specifically that of Git, which is more in line with the way that professional settings handle application production.
